                    St. Joseph University in Tanzania (SJUIT) is a full-fledged University recognized by The Tanzania Commission for Universities (TCU) in its order no:29 dated 21st December, 2011. The history dates back to the dynamic, amazing, and untiring efforts of our Founder Chairman and Chancellor Rev. Fr. Dr. J. E. Arul Raj, who founded the Daughters of Mary Immaculate (DMI) and Collaborators in a remote village in India in the year 1984. Inspired by Christian Biblical virtues and devotion, he spearheaded the team to accomplish the task of serving the most downtrodden by taking on several charity and development activities, doing yeoman service in villages and remote areas. Loving God in serving the poor to be Fully Human and Fully Alive is the Charism of the Society. Today, DMI serves more than 500,000 women, 10,000+ students at College level, 8,000+ students at School level, and 35,000+ children under its care.

                    The DMI and its Collaborators came to Tanzania as missionaries in the year 2003, on the invitation of Cardinal Polycarp Pengo, Archdiocese of Dar es Salaam. The far-sighted vision of the Founder Rev. Fr. Dr. J. E. Arul Raj, the missionary zeal of DMIs, Dr. T. X. A. Ananth, Director for International Operations, assisted by Mr. Ignatius A. Herman, the Director for Education, by their invaluable service toiled hard to make the African Mission a success. Within a short span of time, the small group has turned into a formidable big organization. The DMI and its Collaborators have spread their wings in other East African countries by establishing the DMI-St. Eugene University in Zambia, DMI-St. John the Baptist University in Malawi, and are set to launch and ignite knowledge and spread their mission in Ethiopia and South Sudan.
